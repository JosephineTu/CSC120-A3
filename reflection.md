Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Yunxian Ding; consulted Chatgpt when I found out that String[] cannot perform the tasks I want, and changed some of them to ArrayLists.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
N/A
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I think Java is a more rigorous and precise language compared to python. You have to specify the data type when you create a variable. Also, certain types of variables have fixed lengths, or have to follow special rules when I want to make a change. But object oriented thinking makes accessing variables much easier than local/global scope in Java- I only need to refer to an object in the class, almost regardless of my scope. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
It is hard to conclude, but I would say that a bottom-up processing procedure is always required. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What didn't work: Cannot differentiate between "I" and "me".
What worked: other requirements on the rubric
